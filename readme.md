# Debian

My scripts for installing debian with my configs/dotfiles and programs.

## Usage

Simply run:

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl; sudo curl -L https://github.com/Hasibix/debian/raw/refs/heads/main/debian.sh --progress-bar -o /debian.sh; sudo bash /debian.sh
```

from a Debian live environment.

The scripts will guide you through the installation process.

NOTE: Since this a set of installer scripts, you **WILL** be asked to **wipe the disk** you want to install Debian into.
